    "The movielens dataset contains 1 million movie ratings from several thousand users. We will be using *k*-rank matrix factorization to estimate this dataset as the product $X=UV^T$, where *U* and *V* have only $k$ columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) You can download the movielens 1M dataset from https://datahub.io/dataset/movielens, but for this problem use the data available on Canvas. It has been split into training and test sets, and converted to matrix format where the rows correspond to users and the columns to movies. Note that most of the entries are NaNs, indicating that these ratings are missing. An extra file, lens1m_361M_titles.csv, has been added so you can check out specific movies if you're curious.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Scikit-learn is a little behind for recommender systems, and doesn't have any method to factorize matrices with missing data. Which means you get to code it! Slide 22 of the 'apa large scale learning' lecture notes has the equations for stochastic gradient descent on *U* and *V*. You will have to:\n",
    "* Set up initial guesses for the *U* and *V* matrices. I suggest small random values.\n",
    "* Find a suitable learning rate for the descent. A learning rate that is too large will probably blow up, like in HW3 problem 1.\n",
    "* Come up with a stopping policy\n",
    "* Code the descent algorithm (5 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Using your SGD algorithm, apply 2-rank matrix factorization on the filled training matrix. Calculate the RMSE of this model on the training data and on the test data (separately). The optimal score on the training data is around .86 RMSE; your version of gradient descent must go at least below .91 RMSE. (5 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "4) You should notice some overfitting. Because matrix factorization learns separate scores for each movie, a movie with very few reviews may be easily overfit. You may want to only predict ratings when you have enough information to reach a good conclusion. Recalculate the RMSE on the test data, specifically for movies with at least 50 reviews (don't retrain the models). Also report the percent of movies that are still included (after cutting those with < 50 reviews), and the percent of test ratings that are still included. (5 pts)\n",
