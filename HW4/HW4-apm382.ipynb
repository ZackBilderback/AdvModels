    "In this question you classify hand-written digits. We want to use MNIST data set and try Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier using sklearn package in Python. In order to simplify the problem, we classify digits into 8 classes (digits 0,1,2,...7) and ignore records for digits 8 and 9.  Use the code below to access the data set and extract data with labels 0 to 7, and split the data set into train set and test set.\n",
